           <h2>Overview of His Achievements </h2>
           <p>Amr became Muslim at the same time as Khalid ibn Al-Waleed. He trained in the army until he reached the rank of General.
            In 640 CE he took over the rule of Egypt after defeating the Byzantines in all four battles. After that, he built the first Mosque in Africa.
            Amr was also very just (as Islam orders), and even though he was a Muslim ruler he left the Coptic Christians to continue following their
            faith without any persecution.
