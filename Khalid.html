           <h2>Overview of His Achievements </h2>
           <p>Khalid was a born fighter. He began training at a young age and when he became an adult he ascended to the rank of warrior.
            His bravery earned him fame all over Arabia and any army that stood in his path was ultimately defeated. Many large empires were afraid
            of his large courageous army, even the Byzantine Priests warned their people to stay out of his way. But no matter where Khalid conquered he 
            always made peace with the civillians and they quickly came to love him and his religion which many of them accepted, such as Syria, Iraq
            and the Persian Empire also known as Iran. He truly was Islam's most formidable warrior.
